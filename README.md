MicroTrx
========

MicroTrx is a microtransaction gateway.  The goal is to provide a service that lets a single customer send many microtransactions to many different services.  On the flip side a service can set up payment requests for many customers and validate that the customer has paid.

Since payments funnel through the gateway, the total number of transaction fees will be lowered.
